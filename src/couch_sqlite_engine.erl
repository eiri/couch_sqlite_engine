% This function is called from the context of couch_db_updater

%
% This is probably the most complicated function in the entire

%
% The Pairs argument is a list of pairs (2-tuples) of
% #full_doc_info{} records. The first element of the pair is
% the #full_doc_info{} that exists on disk. The second element
% is the new version that should be written to disk. There are
% three basic cases that should be followed:
%
%     1. {not_found, #full_doc_info{}} - A new document was created
%     2. {#full_doc_info{}, #full_doc_info{}} - A document was updated
%     3. {#full_doc_info{}, not_found} - A document was purged completely
%
% Number one and two are fairly straight forward as long as proper
% accounting for moving entries in the udpate sequence are accounted
% for. However, case 3 you'll notice is "purged completely" which
% means it needs to be removed from the database including the
% update sequence. Also, for engines that are not using append
% only storage like the legacy engine, case 2 can be the result of
% a purge so special care will be needed to see which revisions
% should be removed.
%
% The LocalDocs variable is applied separately. Its important to
% note for new storage engine authors that these documents are
% separate because they should *not* be included as part of the
% changes index for the database.
%
% The PurgedDocIdRevs is the list of Ids and Revisions that were
% purged during this update. While its not guaranteed by the API,
% currently there will never be purge changes comingled with
% standard updates.
%
% Traditionally an invocation of write_doc_infos should be all
% or nothing in so much that if an error occurs (or the VM dies)
% then the database doesn't retain any of the changes. However
% as long as a storage engine maintains consistency this should
% not be an issue as it has never been a guarantee and the
% batches are non-deterministic (from the point of view of the
% client).

% This funciton is called by many processes concurrently.
%
% This function is called to fold over the documents in
% the database sorted by the raw byte collation order of
% the document id. For each document id, the supplied user
% function should be invoked with the first argument set
% to the #full_doc_info{} record and the second argument
% set to the current user supplied accumulator. The return
% value of the user function is a 2-tuple of {Go, NewUserAcc}.
% The NewUserAcc value should then replace the current
% user accumulator. If Go is the atom ok, iteration over
% documents should continue. If Go is the atom stop, then
% iteration should halt and the return value should be
% {ok, NewUserAcc}.
%
% Possible options to this function include:
%
%     1. start_key - Start iteration at the provided key or
%        or just after if the key doesn't exist
%     2. end_key - Stop iteration prior to visiting the provided
%        key
%     3. end_key_gt - Stop iteration just after the provided key
%     4. dir - The atom fwd or rev. This is to be able to iterate
%        over documents in reverse order. The logic for comparing
%        start_key, end_key, and end_key_gt are then reversed (ie,
%        when rev, start_key should be greater than end_key if the
%        user wishes to see results)
%     5. include_reductions - This is a hack for _all_docs since
%        it currently relies on reductions to count an offset. This
%        is a terrible hack that will need to be addressed by the
%        API in the future. If this option is present the supplied
%        user function expects three arguments, where the first
%        argument is a #full_doc_info{} record, the second argument
%        is the current list of reductions to the left of the current
%        document, and the third argument is the current user
%        accumulator. The return value from the user function is
%        unaffected. However the final return value of the function
%        should include the final total reductions as the second
%        element of a 3-tuple. Like I said, this is a hack.
%     6. include_deleted - By default deleted documents are not
%        included in fold_docs calls. However in some special
%        cases we do want to see them (as of now, just in couch_changes
%        during the design document changes optimization)
%
% Historically, if a process calls this function repeatedly it
% would see the same results returned even if there were concurrent
% updates happening. However there doesn't seem to be any instance of
% that actually happening so a storage engine that includes new results
% between invocations shouldn't have any issues.
